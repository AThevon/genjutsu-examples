/genjutsu:paint redesign this site

Atelier Grès is a fictional pottery studio, made up for this example. Everything it has to say is already on the page.

## genjutsu (1)

Reading the studio walls first...

One page, not a multi-page site, so this stays with paint (bunshin doesn't fit). Taking the inventory of what's already there...

**What this project already does by reflex**

The script found no tells: no glow, gradient text, endless animation, generic step labels or em dashes. The inventory points at one reflex, though, and it's the whole look:

- **Warm paper ground with serif ink.** `#f4efe8` paper, `#2b2621` ink and Georgia (`src/index.css:8-10`), plus brown-grey secondary text `#5b5148` (`:46`, `:62`). That's the default for "a craft studio": you could guess it from the category alone, without knowing anything about this studio.
- **No motion system.** No durations, no easings. GSAP is installed (`package.json`) and never imported.
- **No tokens.** 6 hex values are written straight into the CSS. There's one radius (`4px`, `:77`).

You said "redesign", so I'm treating that as **redesign mode**: the whole visual layer can change, existing tokens included. The copy, the four firing stages and their order stay as they are, because you said everything the studio has to say is already on the page.

**My read so far:** a one-page site for a small stoneware studio, for people who buy handmade everyday tableware. It's moving away from the generic craft-on-paper look toward something built from what this studio actually does: gas kiln, reduction firing at 1280 °C, four stages. Stack is React 19 + Vite + plain CSS, with GSAP available. Correct me before I ask anything.

## client (2)

That's right. One thing, though. It shouldn't just be warm and earthy because it's pottery. The colours should come from our clay and the fire, the iron and what reduction does to it. Keep all the words and facts as they are.

## genjutsu (2)

Noted: the palette comes from the clay body, iron and reduction, not from "pottery = earthy". The copy and facts stay word for word.

One question:

**The page follows a piece from wet clay to a cooled kiln. Which moment should the site feel like it's set in?**

- **In the fire.** Dark ground, the glow of a kiln at 1280 °C, iron going black and rust under reduction.
- **After the fire.** The cooled, vitrified surface on a table in daylight, with iron showing as speckle and breaks in the glaze.
- **The whole journey.** The page changes temperature as you scroll through the four stages: pale dry clay at the top, the hottest point in the middle, cooled stoneware at the end.

Your answer decides whether the ground is light or dark, and whether scrolling plays a part in the design or just moves the page.

## client (3)

The whole journey. The four firings are the heart of it, so the page should go from the dry clay through the heat and then wait while it cools, the way the work does.

## genjutsu (3)

That gives the page its shape: scrolling down the page *is* the firing schedule.

Next question:

**How literal should the heat get?**

- **Colour only.** The ground and type shift in temperature, from pale clay to a deep iron red-black at the peak, then back to cooled stoneware. No flames, no glow effects, nothing that looks like fire, only the colours fire leaves behind.
- **Kiln light.** The same colour shift, plus a soft incandescent glow at the glaze-firing stage, like light through a kiln spy-hole. It's the one place the page lights up.
- **Material.** The colour shift, plus texture: the clay surface at the start has a slight grain, and the cooled end turns smooth and glassy.

Whichever you pick, it also tells me what to rule out. Restraint here matters as much as the effect.

## client (4)

Kiln light. The glaze firing in reduction is the moment everything changes, so that should be the one place the page lights up, like looking through the spy-hole. Keep it soft though, it shouldn't look like flames.

## genjutsu (4)

I have enough for both theses now. Before I show them: **how do you want to see them?**

- **A. Rendered page (recommended).** A throwaway HTML page with the palette as swatches showing hex values and contrast ratios, a type specimen, and the temperature arc as you scroll, including the spy-hole glow at the glaze firing. It shows the real easing curve and durations, with replay buttons and a reduced-motion toggle.
- **B. Live preview.** A scratch route inside your Vite project, using your real stack.
- **C. Inline.** Written out here.

I recommend A: a colour arc from dry clay to reduction and back is hard to judge as hex codes in text. Your choice sticks for the rest of the session.

## client (5)

A. I'd like to see the real page change as I scroll. Please put each preview in its own HTML file in a preview folder inside the project so I can open it.

## genjutsu (5)

Brushing the palette from the clay and the kiln. Let me check contrast before anything goes on the page.

Contrast holds everywhere: the lowest pair is rust on bisque at 4.76:1. Now painting the rendered page with the real copy, scroll arc included.

I put the preview in **`preview/theses.html`**. Open it with:

```
open /private/tmp/gj-ex/gres2/preview/theses.html
```

It's the real copy on a throwaway page. Scrolling runs the full temperature arc, and a spec sheet sits below the footer: swatches with contrast ratios, the type scale, the easing curve with a replay button, and the exact numbers. The reduced-motion toggle is in the top bar. This page shows the proposal. It isn't the build.

**Visual thesis:** I'm redesigning the whole visual layer. It's one page whose background follows a piece through the kiln:
- the cool grey-buff of bone-dry clay
- the salmon of bisque
- the near-black of a kiln in reduction, where the only light is a soft spy-hole glow
- the grey-green celadon that reduced iron gives a glaze, at the end

Text is iron-black, and the firing measures are in oxidised-iron rust. The display face is still undecided and gets chosen at the design-system step (it won't be Georgia). It should be one face with tabular figures for the temperatures and a big size jump from body text to headline. The layout is airy: every stage gets at least a full screen, on an 8px base. Everything is flat with no borders: no cards, square corners, no shadows.

**Interaction thesis:** Slow and patient.
- The background colour follows the scroll position and only changes in the gaps between stages, so it holds still while you read.
- The spy-hole glow rises as the glaze firing reaches the middle of the screen. Over the long cooling stage it fades from yellow-orange to dull red to nothing, so the page waits the way the kiln does.
- Text fades in once with a 16px rise over 700ms, eased with `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)`, 120ms apart.
- No hover effects, because the page has nothing to click.
- Forbidden: flames, flicker, particles, parallax, pinning or scroll-jacking, bounce, any looping animation.

**Allowed patterns:** the spy-hole glow (glaze firing and cooling only), the background colour that follows the scroll, a dark background for the glaze firing and cooling, and the firing measures in rust with tabular figures.

Two choices to look at closely when you scroll:

- **The kiln stays dark through cooling** and only gives way to celadon at the footer. That matches "the kiln stays shut while it cools". It also keeps the cooling text off a mid-tone background, where neither dark nor light text would be readable.
- **Celadon comes from reduction, not from "earthy".** Iron under reduction turns a glaze grey-green, so the colour that ends the page is the one the page's own text explains. Every text pair passes 4.5:1. The lowest is rust on bisque at 4.76:1.

Do both theses work for you, or does something feel wrong when you scroll it?

## client (6)

Yes, both work. The page goes through the firing the way the pots do, dry clay, then bisque, then the dark kiln with the one glow, then a long wait before it opens. Ending on the colour reduction gives the glaze feels right. Go ahead.

## genjutsu (6)

Both theses are validated. Next is the design system. Loading `tells` first:

`tells` is loaded. Querying the design-system dataset with the validated visual thesis:

The dataset proposal mostly misses. Before choosing the face, I'm checking that the candidate has real tabular figures:

That glow-row script is convoluted. Simplifying it before you open the page:

The design system is on a rendered page: **`preview/design-system.html`**. Open it with:

```
open /private/tmp/gj-ex/gres2/preview/design-system.html
```

`MASTER.md` is written at the project root. The token and style files wait for your yes.

**Display face: the platform's system face** (SF Pro on Apple, Segoe UI on Windows, Roboto on Android). This adds one clause to the visual thesis. The reasons:
- It has true tabular figures and a proper degree sign for "950 °C" and "1280 °C".
- It switches its optical size between text and display on its own, so one family covers the big jump from body to headline.
- It needs no external font request. Fetching Google Fonts was blocked here, and I didn't want to add a third-party request you hadn't agreed to.

The character of the page comes from the background, not the face. If you'd rather have a distinctive face, give me a font file to host locally, or tell me a Google Fonts link is fine.

**What I took from the design-system dataset, and what I dropped**
- **Took:** a distinct colour per chapter (already in your thesis) and spacious density.
- **Dropped:** the purple, indigo and green palette, the 900-weight 12rem type, the GSAP page-transition snippet (there are no routes), and the "CTA after each chapter" and progress-indicator ideas (the page has no calls to action, so they'd be invented content).
- **Dropped as a reflex:** Amatic SC with Cabin. The dataset maps "craft" and "handmade" to that face out of habit; nothing about this studio chose it.

**Known reflexes this thesis keeps on purpose**
- **A glow:** the spy-hole. It's named in "Allowed patterns" and appears only at the glaze firing and cooling.
- **The clay ground with a rust accent** sits close to the "warm paper" reflex. The difference is that the thesis names it as bone-dry clay, and it's cooler and greyer than paper.

**Dials sent to the dataset**
| Dial | Value | Thesis clause it came from |
|---|---|---|
| variance | 3 | "flat and borderless: no cards, square corners" |
| motion | 4 | "slow and patient… no parallax, pinning or scroll-jacking", with one scroll-linked glow |
| density | 2 | "airy, every stage gets at least a full screen" |

**Token changes** (the project has no tokens today, only 6 hex values written straight into `src/index.css`)
- **Removed:** `#f4efe8` paper, `#fbf8f4` card, `#e2d8cc` border, `#2b2621`, `#5b5148`, `#8a6f57`, Georgia, `4px` radius.
- **Added:** 12 colour tokens, 6 type steps, 9 spacing steps, `--radius-none`, 4 motion tokens, and the band and column layout values. Every token is in `MASTER.md`.
- **Renamed:** none, because nothing had a name before.
- **Unchanged:** all copy, the page title, `lang`, and the order of the four stages.

**How I'll build it**
- `src/tokens.css` holds the tokens, and `src/index.css` is rewritten to use them.
- The scroll-linked background and glow use GSAP's ScrollTrigger. It ships inside the `gsap` package you already have, so nothing new gets installed.

Approve the design system and the token changes, and I'll build the page?

## client (7)

Yes, go ahead. The colours and the plan look right. A Google Fonts link is fine, the live site will be online, so if a face with more character suits the studio better, use one. If the plain one is the better choice, I'm happy with that too.

## genjutsu (7)

I'm keeping the system face. I can't fetch or render a Google font in this sandbox, so I couldn't check its tabular figures or show it to you, and the thesis depends on the figures. The page's character comes from the background colours either way.

Loading the motion modules, one per call:

Page written: tokens, the seams between stages, the spy-hole column, and the GSAP scroll motion. Building now to check it compiles.

The build passes (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`). Updating MASTER.md so it describes what was actually built:

I've built the page and it compiles (`npm run build`: `tsc --noEmit` and `vite build` both pass). I haven't seen it running: I didn't start a dev server. Run it with:

```
cd /private/tmp/gj-ex/gres2 && npm run dev
```

**Two changes from the preview you approved, both to fix contrast:**
- **The colour change is now in the page, not the screen.** Before, the whole screen changed colour at once, so the stage you were leaving sat on a half-mixed colour where neither dark nor light text reached 4.5:1. Now a 40svh gradient sits between each pair of stages and scrolls past. The colour still only changes in the gaps between stages, and text always sits on a solid colour.
- **The spy-hole has a column of its own.** In the preview it sat behind the text, where light text on the glow measured about 1.3:1. Now it's beside the text on wide screens and below it on narrow ones. In cooling it stays pinned at mid-screen for the whole long stage while it dims from yellow-orange to dull red to nothing.

If you preferred the whole screen changing colour at once, say so. Going back means accepting a brief contrast drop each time the colour changes, which is why I didn't keep it.

**What changed in the code**
- **Added `src/tokens.css`:** every token from MASTER.md. I added two new ones there too: `--seam` and `--spyhole-size`.
- **Rewrote `src/index.css`:** every value comes from a token. No hex values or one-off numbers are left in the styles.
- **Added `src/useFiringMotion.ts`:** the scroll-linked spy-hole and the one-time text reveals, using GSAP's ScrollTrigger (it's inside the `gsap` package you already had, so nothing was installed). None of it runs when reduced motion is on. In that case, or without JavaScript, the text is visible straight away, the colour seams stay, and both glows stay still.
- **`App.tsx` and `Firings.tsx`:** new structure and class names. The copy, the facts and the order of the four stages are unchanged, word for word.
- **`MASTER.md`:** updated to match what was built.

Does the page work for you when you scroll it? Once you say yes, I'll run the final audit.

## client (8)

Yes, it works for me. The words are all still there, and the colour changing in the gaps between the stages is fine, better than the text sitting on a muddy colour. Having the glow beside the words, like a spy-hole you look past, feels right. Go ahead with the final check.

## genjutsu (8)

The audit script ran clean. Gathering `file:line` evidence for each promise the theses make:

The redesign is finished and the audit is done. Of the 11 checks I could run here, 1 found a minor problem: an unused colour token. Three tests need a real browser, so you'll have to run them. The build passes.

### Checked here, with evidence (11 checked, 1 problem)

**Problem (minor)**
- **Unused colour token.** `--color-ash-light` (`src/tokens.css:14`) is defined but nothing uses it. Delete it or keep it for later.

**Passed**
- **The code matches the theses.** Each promise is where it should be:
  - each stage at least a full screen: `src/index.css:24`, `src/tokens.css:53`
  - cooling is the long stage: `src/index.css:185`, `src/tokens.css:54`
  - colour changes only in the gaps between stages: `src/index.css:62-72`, `src/tokens.css:57`
  - glow beside the text, never behind it: `src/index.css:219`, `:248`
  - glow pinned on screen during cooling: `src/index.css:244`
  - glow rises at the glaze firing: `src/useFiringMotion.ts:38-42`
  - glow fades from hot to ember during cooling: `src/useFiringMotion.ts:55-62`
  - text reveal (700ms, 16px rise, 120ms stagger, the agreed easing, plays once): `src/tokens.css:66-69`, `src/index.css:277-280`, `src/useFiringMotion.ts:22`
  - square corners: `src/tokens.css:60`
  - tabular figures for the measures: `src/index.css:155`, `:169`
  - system face: `src/tokens.css:22`
  - no shadows: a search for `box-shadow` finds nothing.
- **Reduced motion is respected.** All motion is set up behind a reduced-motion check (`src/useFiringMotion.ts:15`). With reduced motion on, the text is visible straight away (it's only hidden once the script adds the `.motion` class, `src/index.css:276`), and both glows stay still: full at the glaze firing, dim ember at 0.6 in cooling (`src/index.css:236-242`).
- **Exit animations aren't needed.** Nothing appears or disappears while the page is open. The audit script found no conditional render without an exit.
- **Nothing animates layout.** Only `opacity` and `transform` are animated, and the script confirms it.
- **Focus styles aren't needed.** The page has no links, buttons or inputs (searched for them), and no rule removes a focus outline.
- **Interactive states aren't needed** (default, hover, focus, active, disabled), for the same reason: nothing on the page is interactive.
- **Every colour and size comes from a token.** All 12 hex values live only in `src/tokens.css`, and `index.css` contains none.
- **All text passes contrast, computed from the token values:**

  | Background | Text | Ratio |
  |---|---|---|
  | dry clay `#D7D1C6` | ink | 11.35:1 |
  | | ash (secondary text) | 5.99:1 |
  | | rust (measures) | 5.44:1 |
  | bisque `#DDBFA8` | ink | 9.92:1 |
  | | ash | 5.24:1 |
  | | rust | 4.76:1 |
  | kiln `#17110E` | bone (text) | 13.8:1 |
  | | glow-mid (measures) | 7.49:1 |
  | celadon `#BCCBC3` (footer) | ink | 10.23:1 |

- **Screen readers skip the glow.** It's marked decorative with `aria-hidden` (`src/Firings.tsx:54`), and there are no clickable `div`s. The GSAP animations are cleaned up when the page unmounts (`src/useFiringMotion.ts:73`), and no `will-change` was used.
- **Common AI-design tells: none found.** The script's 18 checks came back clean. I read the rest by hand:
  - **Every stage has the same layout:** not a problem here. The glaze and cooling stages differ, with their own glow column and the long pinned cooling stage (`src/index.css:185`, `:244`).
  - **Copy:** the text in `Firings.tsx` matches the original word for word: no em dashes, no filler words, the same tone throughout.
  - **Other tells:** no monospace type, no fake product screenshot, no stray floating paragraph.
  - **Known reflexes kept on purpose:** the glow and the clay background with a rust accent are both named in the thesis's "Allowed patterns".

### You need to run these yourself (not verified here)

| What to run | It passes if |
|---|---|
| Chrome DevTools > Performance, recording while scrolling the whole page | no frame takes longer than 16.7ms |
| The page at 375, 768, 1024 and 1440px wide | no sideways scroll, nothing cut off, and the glow sits below the text under 1024px (64rem) and beside it above |
| The page with your system's "reduce motion" setting on | text shows straight away, the glows are still, the colour gaps between stages remain |

### Files
- **Added:** `MASTER.md`, `src/tokens.css`, `src/useFiringMotion.ts`
- **Rewritten:** `src/index.css`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/Firings.tsx` (the copy is unchanged)
- **Previews:** `preview/theses.html` and `preview/design-system.html` are throwaway pages and no longer match what was built. Delete the `preview/` folder when you're done with them.
- **Nothing installed.** The scroll motion uses GSAP's ScrollTrigger, which comes with the `gsap` package you already had.

## client (9)

Please tidy up the one problem you found, the colour that isn't used. Then I'm happy.

## genjutsu (9)

I've removed the unused colour, `--color-ash-light`. It's gone from `src/tokens.css` and from the colour table and contrast notes in `MASTER.md`, and a search finds no other mention in `src/` or `MASTER.md`. The build still passes.

That leaves no open problems from the audit. Three checks still need a real browser: scrolling performance in DevTools, the four screen widths, and reduced motion. The `preview/` folder no longer matches the build and can be deleted.
