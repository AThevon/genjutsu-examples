description: Baseline case. Landing page for Ploverdesk, a fictional B2B SaaS that matches supplier invoices against purchase orders, with an explicit request for a minimal, restrained style. The same brief is run with no plugin, with Anthropic's frontend-design skill and with genjutsu paint.

/genjutsu:paint build the landing page for Ploverdesk.

The brief. Ploverdesk is a fictional product made up for this example, and this is everything its founders have given us:

- Ploverdesk is software for the finance teams of mid-size wholesalers, sold to companies, not to individuals. It reads the supplier invoices that arrive by email as PDF, matches every line against the purchase order and the delivery note (a three-way match), and shows a person only the lines that do not match: a wrong quantity, a wrong unit price, a delivery that never arrived. Invoices that match go straight to payment approval.
- Matched invoices are exported to the accounting system as a CSV file or through an API. Data is hosted in Frankfurt, in the EU.
- Price: 290 EUR per month per company, with no limit on users. A 14-day trial needs no credit card.
- The company was founded in 2025 and is six people in Rotterdam. It has no customer logos, no testimonials and no usage numbers to show yet: invent none, and invent no other figure.
- The page has one job: get a finance lead to start the trial, at /trial. A second, quieter link books a demo, at /demo.
- Style: they want it minimal and restrained. Quiet, precise, nothing decorative.

Nobody is available to answer questions during this session: where your process would ask something or wait for an approval, decide yourself and carry on.
- If your process shows previews before it builds, write each one as a standalone HTML file under preview/ in the project.
- Scope: the landing page. You may write src/, index.html, public/, preview/ and MASTER.md; create nothing outside the project.
- Dependencies are installed (node_modules is present) and `npm run build` works. There is no network: install nothing. Do not start a dev server.

Finish with a short report of what you built and what you left unverified.
