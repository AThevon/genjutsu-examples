/genjutsu:paint build the landing page for Nocturne, the late program of a planetarium in Lisbon.

The brief. The planetarium and its program are fictional, made up for this example: give the planetarium no name and do not name or suggest any real planetarium or venue. This is everything we have:

- Nocturne is the planetarium's after-hours program. On Friday and Saturday nights the dome first shows the night sky above Lisbon as it is that evening, with a narrator, then a 40-minute show. Doors 21:30, first show 22:00, last show 23:30. Tickets 12 EUR, 8 EUR for students, booked at /tickets.
- The hero is the sky over Lisbon as the dome will show it at 22:00 on Friday 9 October 2026. data/stars.json holds the brightest stars of the Yale Bright Star Catalogue (public domain) and the one bright planet above the horizon then, Saturn (from NASA JPL Horizons), with their altitude and azimuth already computed for that place and time, their magnitude and, for stars, their proper name when they have one. It also lists the Moon and the other planets, which are below the horizon or too faint at that time: do not draw them. Use it. Do not invent stars, constellation lines, events or claims that are not in the data or in this brief.
- The page scrolls from dusk to the first show: the program, what is in tonight's sky, the practical information.
- It is for adults in their 20s to 40s looking for an evening out, not school groups. There are no reviews and no attendance numbers yet: the program launches with this page.

## genjutsu (1)

Scanning the ground before the first brushstroke...

Stack read: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript, plain CSS, no animation library, no existing visual identity (an empty `App.tsx` and a CSS reset). The data is solid: 403 stars down to magnitude 4.5, 150 of them with IAU names, Saturn at 33.7° altitude, azimuth 119° (east-south-east), magnitude 0.36, and every other planet and the Moon checked and below the cut. It's a single landing page, not a multi-page site, so this stays in paint.

My read so far: a one-page launch site for Nocturne, the planetarium's Friday and Saturday late program, for adults in their 20s to 40s planning a night out. It moves from dusk to the 22:00 show, built around a real, accurate render of the 9 October 2026 sky over Lisbon. It should feel nocturnal and grown-up, not educational, on React + Vite + plain CSS with native APIs only. Correct me before I ask anything.

## client (2)

That's right. One thing to add: the times, the prices and where to book should be easy to find. Nobody should have to hunt for 22:00 or 12 euros.

## genjutsu (2)

Noted: 22:00, 12 EUR / 8 EUR and /tickets will always be visible, not tucked away in a footer.

First question, about mood, since the rest of the brief already covers product, audience and stack:

**For this crowd, what kind of night out is Nocturne closer to? A quiet, almost hushed date-night thing (low light, slow, intimate), or a city outing with some energy (a late screening or a gig, a bit of edge)?** And if something comes to mind, what would feel wrong for it? For example: too "science museum", too "nightclub", too "luxury spa".

## client (3)

Quiet, closer to a date night. People come after dinner and talk softly while the lights go down. It shouldn't feel like a nightclub, and it shouldn't feel like a science museum or a school trip. No space wallpaper either: no purple gas clouds, no glowing swirls, no rocket. It should feel like going out in the city, just darker and calmer.

## genjutsu (3)

That rules out a lot: no nebulas, no glow, no neon, no bright edutainment colors. Calm, adult, Lisbon after dinner.

Next question, about the hero, since it drives the layout of the whole page:

**How should the 22:00 sky be framed? Option 1 is the dome view: the whole sky as one disc, zenith in the middle and the horizon around the edge, the way you'd see it lying back in a dome seat. Option 2 is the street view: a wide band of sky above the horizon, facing roughly east-south-east toward Saturn, the way you'd see it standing on a Lisbon miradouro.** Or do you have a reference (a site, a poster, a photo) that already has the feel you want?

## client (4)

1, the dome view. That's how people will see it from their seats, lying back with the whole sky overhead. If the horizon around the edge can show the city glow fading as you scroll, even better. I don't have a reference to share.

## genjutsu (4)

That's enough to write both theses: product, audience, mood, references (none, so I'm not anchoring on anyone else's look) and stack are all covered. One thing I'm assuming rather than asking: **the copy is in English**, the same language as the brief. Tell me if it should be Portuguese or bilingual.

About the glow: I'll treat it as the dome's house lights going down, a staging device rather than a light-pollution claim. That way the page doesn't say anything the data can't back up.

Before I show you the theses, how do you want to see them?

**A. Rendered page (recommended)**: a standalone HTML file with the real palette swatches and contrast ratios, the type specimen, a small dome-sky sample drawn from `stars.json`, and the scroll dimming running at its real easing and duration. I'll give you the path to open, because this sandbox can't launch a browser.
**B. Live preview**: a throwaway route inside this Vite project.
**C. Inline**: written out here in the conversation.

## client (5)

A, the rendered page. Please save each preview as a standalone HTML file in a preview/ folder inside the project so I can open it. English is fine for the copy.

## genjutsu (5)

Writing the theses, then drawing the preview straight from `stars.json`. First I'm checking the palette contrast with real numbers instead of eyeballing it.

The `faint` value fails as body text (4.12:1), so I'll only use it for the dome rim and its tick marks, where 3:1 is enough. Drawing the preview page now.

The preview page is written. I'm syntax-checking its script before I hand it over.

The preview is ready: **`preview/thesis.html`**. Open it with `open /private/tmp/gj-ex/nocturne/preview/thesis.html` (the sandbox blocks me from launching a browser). The page is the proposal, not the build; it gets thrown away once the theses are approved. Its script parses, but I haven't seen it rendered: it loads Jost from Google Fonts, so it needs a connection.

**Visual thesis:** A darkened dome, not outer space. The ground starts at dusk blue `#1A2638` and deepens to night `#07090E` as you scroll. Ink is a warm off-white, each star is tinted from its catalogue B-V colour index, Saturn is pale gold, and one sodium-amber accent is reserved for booking. Display type is **Jost** at weight 300: its geometric, compass-drawn circles echo the dome and the star chart, and the light weight reads like talking softly. The same family at 400 and 500 carries the facts, with tabular figures. Spacing is airy on an 8px base, with tall sections. Components are flat and sharp-cornered (2px radius at most), drawn with 1px hairlines and no shadows; the dome is the only circle on the page. A pinned facts bar (Fri & Sat, doors 21:30, 22:00 / 23:30, 12 € / 8 €, Book) stays visible from the first screen.

**Interaction thesis:** Slow and hushed. Dusk is mapped linearly to scroll: the ground deepens, the amber house-light glow at the dome rim fades out, and stars appear brightest-first by catalogue magnitude. The sky is complete by the time you reach the first show. Text reveals once, with opacity and an 8px rise, over 700ms on `cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)` with a 90ms stagger. Hover only brightens colour, over 200ms. Named stars show their name and magnitude on hover or keyboard focus. Forbidden: twinkling, shooting stars, sky rotation, parallax, bounce or springs, blurred glows, cursor effects, any looping animation. With reduced motion, the full night sky shows at once and nothing reveals.

**Allowed patterns:** compass letters N / E / S / W and two faint altitude rings (30°, 60°) on the dome; 1px hairline rules; the amber rim glow (tied to scroll, never loops); the pinned facts bar; tabular figures for times and prices; small tracked uppercase labels, only on the dome compass and practical-info terms; star tints from catalogue B-V.

**What the page shows:**
- **The dome:** drawn from all 403 stars plus Saturn. Scroll inside its frame to run the dusk.
- **Palette:** every colour with its computed contrast ratio. Ink on night is 15.56:1. Muted (secondary text) is 5.8:1 on dusk, its weakest background. Faint (lines only) is 4.12:1, too low for body text, so it is only used for lines.
- **Type, spacing, radii and components:** the Jost specimen, the spacing, radius and shadow scales, the button in all five states, and the practical-info card.
- **Motion:** the easing curve with a replay, a reduced-motion toggle, and the three design-system dials (variance 4, motion 3, density 2), each with the thesis wording it comes from.

**Assumptions:** the copy is in English, there's no logo yet so "Nocturne" is set in Jost 300 as a wordmark, and fonts are served from Google Fonts.

Do both theses work for you as they stand? If something feels off (the amber, Jost, the brightest-first reveal), tell me which part.

## client (6)

Yes, both work. It's our sky: the real stars from the catalogue, Saturn low in the east-south-east as the only planet, no lines drawn between stars, and the house lights going down as you scroll. The facts bar showing 22:00 and 12 euros from the start is exactly what I asked for. Go ahead.

## genjutsu (6)

Both theses validated. Loading the reflex list before the design-system lookup...

Writing MASTER.md and the CSS tokens.

Design system written. Rendering it as a page, as agreed.

The design system is ready for review: **`preview/design-system.html`** (open it with `open /private/tmp/gj-ex/nocturne/preview/design-system.html`). Like the thesis preview, it's the proposal, not the build. I haven't seen it rendered either.

**Files written:**
- `MASTER.md`: the source of truth. It holds both theses, the content rules taken from the brief, and every token with its computed contrast.
- `src/styles/tokens.css`: the CSS variables that mirror `MASTER.md`.

**On the page:**
- **Palette:** every colour with its contrast on night and on dusk. Ink is 15.56:1 on night. Muted is 5.80:1 on dusk, its weakest background. Night text on the pressed amber is 7.11:1. Faint stays lines-only, since 4.12:1 is too low for text.
- **Type:** the Jost scale at real sizes, with tabular figures for times and prices.
- **Spacing, radii and shadows:** spacing on an 8px base, three radii (0, 2px, and round for the dome only), and no shadows at any level.
- **Components:** the Book button, the text link and the star chip, each in all five states, live as well as shown statically.
- **The practical block and the motion tokens.**
- **The page plan:** hero, program, tonight's sky, practical, closing. Dusk reaches full night at the "22:00" closing section.

**The three dials** sent to the design-system lookup, each from a line of the theses:
- **Variance 4**, from "the dome is the only circle on the page".
- **Motion 3**, from "slow and hushed … no looping animation".
- **Density 2**, from "airy on an 8px base, with tall sections".

**What I took from the lookup:** dark-only, with a WCAG AAA target.

**What I dropped:**
- Its "waitlist" pattern: a countdown and a waitlist count would be invented numbers.
- The light navy palette.
- The Lora and Raleway fonts.
- A text-shadow glow.
- A GSAP code snippet.

**Known reflexes the thesis allows:** hairline rules and one glow (the amber rim glow at the dome edge, fading with scroll). I'll keep the facts bar separated by space rather than middle dots, because the thesis doesn't name that pattern.

**Two content decisions in the plan, both taken from the data:**
- The "Tonight's sky" section says there's no Moon. The data shows it below the horizon and under 1% lit.
- It also says that each Nocturne night shows that night's own sky, so the dome on 9 October is one specific example.

Shall I build the page from this design system?

## client (7)

Yes, build it. The Moon note and the line about each night showing its own sky are both right, and it's good that the facts stay in view the whole way down.

## genjutsu (7)

Approved. Loading the motion modules, one per call...

Building the page, section by section, with tokens only.

The sky data, the dome and the scroll-to-dusk hook are written. Next I'm writing the page sections and their styles.

Build passes. Checking whether a headless browser is available so I can actually look at the page.

Local port binding is blocked in this sandbox (enable it with `sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding: true` if you want). Instead I'll inline the build into one file and screenshot it from disk.

Rebuilding, then running the audit.

Collecting `file:line` evidence for each thesis promise.

I've built the Nocturne landing page in React + Vite. `npm run build` passes, including `tsc --noEmit`, but I haven't seen the page rendered. The sandbox blocks local servers and headless Chrome, so the visual check is yours. To run it: `npm run dev`, or `npm run build && npm run preview`.

## What's on the page

**Facts bar, always pinned at the top:** Fri & Sat, doors 21:30, first show 22:00, last show 23:30, 12 €, students 8 €, and a **Book tickets** button linking to `/tickets`. That label is the only call to action, used everywhere.

**The dome:** the 403 catalogue stars plus Saturn, drawn as you'd see them lying back (north at the top, east on the left). Each star is tinted from its catalogue colour index. Only `stars` and `planets` are drawn. The Moon entry from the data is used only for the "No Moon" sentence.

**Scrolling from dusk to the first show:**
- **At the top:** the ground is dusk blue, the amber house-light glow sits on the dome rim, and only Vega, Capella and Saturn are lit.
- **As you scroll:** the ground deepens to night, the glow fades out, and stars appear brightest-first.
- **At the closing "22:00" section:** the sky is complete.

**Sections:**
1. Hero.
2. "First the sky, then the show": the program.
3. "The sky on Friday 9 October":
   - The line that each night shows its own sky.
   - Saturn: 34° up, magnitude 0.36, five days after opposition, outshone only by Vega and Capella.
   - No Moon: below the horizon, 0.8% lit.
   - Saturn and the 12 brightest stars as buttons. Hovering, tapping or tabbing to one highlights it on the dome.
4. Practical information.
5. Closing "22:00" section, then the data credits, including the IAU credit for star names that the licence requires.

**Layout:** from 1100px wide, the text runs in a left column with the dome pinned on the right. Below that, the dome stays near the top and the text scrolls over it on solid panels, with sky showing between them.

## Two changes made during the build (now in MASTER.md)

- **The hero dome was empty.** At the very top of the page no star was lit, so I changed the threshold formula so Vega, Capella and Saturn show from the start.
- **Colours now come from the tokens.** The ink and Saturn colours were hard-coded in `sky.ts`, and the rim glow used `var()` inside SVG attributes, which browsers don't reliably read. Both now take their colours from tokens through CSS.

## Audit

**13 checked, 4 problems found, 6 handed over to you.** The script ran 28 static checks, 2 of which flagged something, and both turned out not to be real problems.

**Checked here:**
- **Thesis against code:** every promise has a matching line.
  - Easing, durations and stagger: `tokens.css:65–69`.
  - Reveal: `index.css:521`, `index.css:530`.
  - Dusk colour: `useDusk.ts:26`.
  - Glow fade: `Dome.tsx:101`.
  - Brightest-first: `Dome.tsx:104` with `sky.ts:47`.
  - Star tints: `sky.ts:54`.
  - Pinned bar: `index.css:74`.
  - Jost at weight 300: `index.html:15`, `index.css:46`.
  - Tabular figures: `index.css:111`.
  - No shadows except the disabled button's inset ring: `index.css:181`.
- **Reduced motion:** passes. `useDusk.ts:22` fixes dusk at 1, so the full night sky shows at once, and `index.css:535` turns off the reveals and hover transitions.
- **Exit animations:** pass. The script flagged `Dome.tsx:144`, but the highlight stays mounted after first use and fades out (`index.css:305–311`).
- **Hover transitions:** pass. The script flagged 4 hover rules, but the transitions are declared on their base selectors (`index.css:170`, `191`, `433`).
- **No layout-property animation, no clickable divs, no infinite animation, no `will-change`, focus outlines kept:** all clean in the script.
- **Contrast,** computed from the token values:

  | Pair | Ratio |
  |---|---|
  | ink on night | 15.56:1 |
  | ink on dusk | 11.91:1 |
  | muted on dusk | 5.80:1 |
  | night text on amber | 9.33:1 |
  | night text on hover amber | 11.07:1 |
  | night text on pressed amber | 7.11:1 |
  | faint (lines only) on dusk | 3.15:1, passes the 3:1 bar for UI lines |

- **Reflexes:** 18 checks, 0 findings. Two known reflexes are in use and both are in the validated thesis: hairline rules, and the one amber glow on the dome rim.
- **Manual read:** every section uses the same left-column layout. The approved design system specifies that layout, but the thesis doesn't name it among its allowed patterns.

**Problems found:**
1. **Keyboard reach is partial.** Keyboard users can reach Saturn and the 12 brightest stars through the buttons, but the other 138 named stars on the dome only respond to a mouse. I chose this to avoid about 150 extra tab stops.
2. **On phones, the star buttons may not highlight anything visible.** The panel holding the buttons can cover the dome while you're using them.
3. **The "Nocturne" wordmark link has no hover or active state.**
4. **A few hard-coded values remain outside the tokens:**
   - the 70svh / 50svh gaps between panels on mobile;
   - `padding-top: 0.3em` at `index.css:482`;
   - letter-spacing tweaks of -0.01em and 0.02em;
   - fallback heights for the bar.

**For you to run (UNVERIFIED):**
- **Look at the page at all.** I never saw it render.
- **Chrome DevTools > Performance**, recorded while scrolling the page. Pass: no frame over 16.7ms.
- **The page at 375, 768, 1024 and 1440px wide.** Pass: no horizontal scroll and no clipped content. Also check that the hero panel on a phone doesn't cover too much of the dome.
- **The page with the OS "reduce motion" setting on.** Pass: full night sky immediately, nothing fades in.
- **Hover a star on the dome, and tab through the star buttons.** Pass: name and magnitude appear next to the star.
- **Load the page offline, or with Google Fonts blocked.** It should fall back to the system sans. Loading fonts from Google is also a privacy question under EU rules, so consider self-hosting Jost.

## Files

- **New:** `MASTER.md`, `src/styles/tokens.css`, `src/sky.ts`, `src/Dome.tsx`, `src/useDusk.ts`.
- **Rewritten:** `src/App.tsx`, `src/index.css`, `index.html`.
- **Previews, kept as you asked:** `preview/thesis.html`, `preview/design-system.html`.
- **No dependencies added.**

## client (8)

The sky checks out, including the line about opposition. Before we finish, please fix the four problems you listed, in one go. Every star name on the dome should be reachable without a mouse, and the star buttons should actually show the star on a phone, not hide it behind the panel. The wordmark needs a hover and a pressed state, and the leftover hard-coded values should go into the design system.

## genjutsu (8)

Reading the current files first, since they changed on disk.

Build passes with all four fixes in. Updating MASTER.md to match, then re-running the audit.

Running the audit again.

I've fixed all four problems, and `npm run build` passes, including `tsc --noEmit`. Since the sandbox blocks both local servers and headless Chrome, I still haven't seen any of this run in a browser: the keyboard, touch and docking behaviour need a try on your side.

## The four fixes

**1. Every named star on the dome is reachable without a mouse.** The dome now holds all 150 named bodies (149 named stars plus Saturn) as one keyboard stop. Each one is announced with its name, direction, altitude and magnitude.
- **Tab** enters on Saturn.
- **Arrow keys** move to the nearest named star in that direction. On their own they reach 149 of the 150; Thuban is always beaten by a closer neighbour.
- **Page Down / Page Up** step through every named star from brightest to faintest, and **Home / End** jump to either end. This sequence is what guarantees every name is reachable.
- **Showing the key help:** the dome caption shows the keys while the dome has focus.
- **Focus indicator:** the shared ink outline, plus the amber ring around the star thickening to 2px.
- **Stars not yet lit:** a picked star is drawn by the highlight itself, so it shows even before dusk has lit it.
- **Touch:** a tap on the dome picks the nearest lit named star within 22px (half of the 44px touch target). A tap on empty sky clears it.

**2. On a phone, the star buttons no longer hide the star.** Below 1100px the button list docks just under the dome's caption, on a solid background, and scrolls inside itself. It holds there for at least one screen height of page scroll. Its track starts one dome-height below the intro paragraph, so the intro has scrolled off the screen by the time the list docks. Desktop is unchanged.

**3. The wordmark has hover and pressed states.**
- **Hover:** its underline goes from transparent to ink over 200ms.
- **Pressed:** the text turns muted (7.58:1 on night).
- **Focus:** the shared outline.
- **Reduced motion:** the transition is off.

**4. The hard-coded values are now design tokens.**
- **Spacing and gaps:** the 70svh and 50svh gaps on mobile are now `--gap-sky` and `--gap-sky-hero`.
- **Type:** the letter-spacings are `--tracking-display` and `--tracking-ui`, plus `--lh-none` and `--fs-ui`.
- **Focus and underline offsets:** `--focus-offset`, `--focus-offset-tight` and `--underline-offset`.
- **Other new tokens:** `--o-ring` (altitude ring opacity), `--chip-min`, `--col-text`, `--col-dome`, `--dome-mobile`, `--dock-hold` and `--line-strong`.
- **The 0.3em nudge** is gone: the practical table now aligns its rows on the baseline instead.
- **Bar-height fallbacks:** replaced by first-paint defaults in `tokens.css` for `--bar-h` and `--sky-bottom`, which the script overwrites at runtime.

The remaining literals in `index.css` are the standard 1px visually-hidden pattern, the `100svh` layout units and the two breakpoints. Media queries can't read custom properties, so MASTER.md now documents the breakpoints (900px and 1100px). It also documents every new token, the wordmark's five states, how the dome responds to mouse, touch and keyboard, the docked list, and the dome's SVG geometry constants.

## Audit, re-run

**The static checks:** 28 ran and 2 flagged something. Neither is a real problem, and I checked both against the code:
- **"Conditional render with no exit animation"** at `Dome.tsx:256`: the guard only covers the very first pick. After that the highlight stays mounted and fades out.
- **"Hover state with no transition"**: the transitions are declared on the base selectors (`.btn`, `.link`, `.facts__brand`, `.star-item`).

**Reflexes:** 18 checks, 0 findings.

**Focus outline:** while working I removed the browser focus outline from the dome targets, and the audit flagged that as critical. I put the outline back rather than relying only on the thicker ring.

**For you to run (UNVERIFIED):**
- **Keyboard:** Tab into the dome and walk it with the arrows and Page Up / Page Down. Pass: the star's name shows each time, and Thuban is reachable with Page Down.
- **Touch:** on a phone at 390×844, scroll to the star list. Pass: the list docks under the dome and tapping a button shows that star above it. Tapping a lit star on the dome shows its name.
- **Screen reader** (VoiceOver or NVDA): Pass: the dome is announced as a list of stars, each with its details. SVG support in screen readers varies, so this one matters.
- **Mouse:** hover and press the wordmark.
- **Earlier checks still standing:**
  - Chrome DevTools Performance while scrolling: no frame over 16.7ms.
  - The page at 375, 768, 1024 and 1440px wide.
  - The page with OS reduce-motion on.
